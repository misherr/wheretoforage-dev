# King Bolete Forecast — Washington State

A static web app that maps king bolete (*Boletus edulis*) foraging odds across
Washington, so the user can decide each morning whether it is worth driving
somewhere. Used on iPhone via "Add to Home Screen". No build step, no
dependencies, no server: GitHub Pages serves `index.html` plus three baked JSON
files.

**This file is the operating manual — kept short on purpose.** The reasoning,
the incident history and the long-form detail live in [`docs/`](docs/), indexed
at the bottom. Those writeups are why several bugs have not recurred; when
something here says "see X", read X before changing that area.

## Architecture

```
index.html      the app: Leaflet map, canvas overlay, tap sheet, Top spots
src/model/      the ecological model — the science, and nothing else
src/grid.mjs    the cell lattice, the state outline, terrainAt, pointKey
src/access.mjs  how you would reach a cell — a separate axis, never a score input
src/coords.mjs  the coordinate readout and the paste parser
scripts/        build-cells.mjs, build-access.mjs, fetch-weather.mjs, serve.mjs,
                access-network.mjs (the network, the drive and the bike), access-modes.mjs (per-cell figures),
                fetch-habitat.mjs + habitat-grid.mjs (the 30 m raster fetch — no emission yet)
tests/model/    the model regression suite
data/           cells.json, weather.json, evt-names.json, access.json (+ -hike/-drive/-bike/-moto,
                -geom, access-routes/) — checked in
```

Washington is divided into ~48,000 one-square-mile cells. Each carries baked
terrain and vegetation; weather is fetched for a much sparser set of **anchors**
and joined to cells at load time. A score is
`habitat × trigger rain × soil moisture × temperature × humidity`, multiplied by
a vegetation term, with kill switches for frost, snow and heat.

`index.html` is a `<script type="module">`, so **a local server is mandatory** —
`file://` fails CORS on every import and the page comes up blank with an error
that does not say so. File-by-file detail:
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Hard rules

1. **Never push to `main` unless explicitly told.** `dev` is where work happens.
2. **Scoring changes need the user's explicit sign-off.** Constants, thresholds,
   habitat regions, host rules, the structure curve — all tuned by hand against
   field experience, not derived from a spec. This includes changes that *look*
   like obvious corrections.
3. **Do not regenerate `data/cells.json` unless asked.** It is the real baked
   dataset. A rebuild is reproducible, but it moves scores.
4. **Every workflow is repository-guarded, and they point in opposite
   directions** — `weather.yml` and `test.yml` to `misherr/wheretoforage`,
   `staging-pages.yml` to `misherr/wheretoforage-dev`. The staging repo is a full
   mirror, so an unguarded workflow runs twice; `weather.yml` was unguarded once
   and spent a second day's Open-Meteo quota. Any new workflow needs a guard.
5. **`--force-with-lease`, never a bare `--force`**, and `git fetch preview`
   first. A bare force nearly destroyed a commit here already.
6. **Kill node by PID.** `taskkill //IM node.exe` kills every node process on the
   machine, including Adobe's.
7. **Read [`src/model/CLAUDE.md`](src/model/CLAUDE.md) before touching
   `src/model/`.** It carries that directory's rules, and
   `tests/model/purity.test.mjs` enforces them mechanically.
8. **Access never touches a score.** It is a separate axis: its own module
   outside `src/model/`, its own data file, its own section of the tap sheet, and
   a *sort* option in Top spots. Tests assert the model cannot even see it.
   **A filter is allowed only if it is explicit, counted and off by default** —
   "within a 2-hour hike" hides cells, never changes a score, and says how many
   it hides and how many of those simply have no mapped route. The rule exists so
   access can never *silently* suppress ground; a filter the viewer turned on and
   can see the cost of does not do that. (Amended 2026-09-11 at the user's
   request, when the hike mode added filters.) [docs/access.md](docs/access.md)

## Critical invariants

The things that break *quietly* — the map goes blank or the numbers go wrong
while nothing throws.

- **All cell → anchor resolution goes through `anchorHit(lat, lon)`.** Never
  derive anchor coordinates independently. This seam has broken twice, and both
  times every individual tap still returned correct data while the overlay drew
  nothing. [docs/cell-anchor-join.md](docs/cell-anchor-join.md)
- **Grid membership is per anchor, never stride arithmetic.** Deciding by
  `stored.stride % grid.stride === 0` throws away 464 usable anchors and their
  history. [docs/weather-archive.md](docs/weather-archive.md)
- **`scripts/build-cells.mjs` and `index.html` must agree about the lattice.**
  They share `src/grid.mjs` for exactly that reason. A second copy drifts, and
  that has cost 5,844 mismatched cells once and 74 orphaned anchors another time.
- **`today_index` beats the viewer's clock.** Do not simplify `todayIndex()` back
  to a local-date lookup; a viewer one day ahead resolved tomorrow's forecast as
  now.
- **A missing or unrecognised vegetation type is a penalty, not an estimate**
  (`HOST_NO_INFO`). It multiplied by 1.0 once and all 39,981 forested cells
  scored as though their trees were ideal, for days, invisibly.
- **The model is deterministic and takes `doy` as an argument.** Nothing under
  `src/model/` may read the clock, the DOM or the network.
- **Roads and trails on the map are a rendered raster, not our data.** The overlay is OpenTopoMap's
  rendering of OSM, multiplied over the imagery through a filter that whitens its fills
  (`ROAD_OVERLAYS` in `index.html`). The blend and filter are set on the Leaflet **pane** — set on
  anything inside it they multiply against nothing — and the approach line has a pane above it. Two
  vector layers built from the access bake came first: one drew the cells' references, a scatter of
  stubs; the next drew OSM's and USFS's copies of the same road as two lines of two kinds. Drawing
  the network and answering "how do I reach this cell" are separate jobs; do not rebuild the first
  from the second. The OpenTopoMap credit is its licence's wording, not a courtesy.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#roads-and-trails-on-the-map-are-somebody-elses-rendering)
- **Categories and trailheads are decided at assembly, after the rules — never inherited from the
  fetch.** Where OSM and USFS map the same road, USFS's maintenance level decides, except that OSM's
  paved surface makes it drivable (not over the closed-roads layer) and `4wd_only=yes`,
  `motor_vehicle=no` or `smoothness=impassable|very_horrible` make it rough. Over-snow USFS routes
  are dropped. A USFS record is one way per path, never flattened. A trailhead is inferred only
  after all of that, so a trail whose only road USFS calls high-clearance gets no walk rather than a
  walk from where a car cannot go. Trailheads were once inferred during the fetch, against whatever
  each source alone called drivable; 8.4% of them rested on such a road.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#two-sources-one-road)
- **A hike figure starts where a car can get to, and says so.** Drivable roads connected to
  pavement, stopping at mapped gates — barriers *on* roads, never beside them — and at private or
  permit roads; then any trail, track or gated road on foot, and a straight line off trail at the
  end. The approach given is the fastest that keeps the off-trail leg within `BUSHWHACK_M`, and a
  bushwhack only when none does. The worst case — the same walk from the nearest paved road — is
  always shown beside it, because a gate nobody mapped is invisible to the network: that is the
  Deming case, and the worst case is what makes it visible. That walk is the bound for the hike and
  the drive; the riding modes have one of their own (below). Minutes and buckets are computed in the
  app from stored parts; never bake a threshold into the file.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#how-far-in-on-foot-the-hike-mode)
- **A drive figure is minutes from the nearest paved road, and the walk that is left.** The same
  network and the same stopping rules as the hike — drivable roads, mapped gates, private and
  permit-only roads — timed at 35 mph on pavement, 25 on a graded forest road or a street, 15 on
  anything rougher, with the metres stored per class so a speed can change without a re-bake. The
  parking point is the one that makes the WHOLE journey fastest, drive plus walk, which is not always
  where the hike leaves the car: the hike counts foot minutes alone. They agree for 94.1% of cells,
  and the routes file stores the drive's walk only for the rest. A street counts as graded because 61%
  of the drivable network this code calls unpaved is `highway=residential` — timing those at 15 mph is
  not pessimism, it is wrong about a street.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#getting-there-by-car-the-drive-mode)
- **A dirt bike is the mode the closed-roads layer is for, and silence on a trail means closed.**
  It rides roads, tracks and level 1–2 spurs at 25/20/10 mph with 2 min per 100 m of climb, is
  stopped by wilderness, by the USFS closed-to-motorized layer, by `motor_vehicle=no` and the other
  access tags, and **on singletrack unless motorized use is recorded** — which it is for 996 mi of
  Washington's trail against 4,762 mi with nothing recorded. Treating silence as closed was the
  user's instruction and the right error direction: the optimistic reading hands a rider thousands of
  miles that are mostly illegal. **A conservative mode must be legible as conservative**, so the
  sheet prints the excluded mileage from the bake (`excluded` in `access-moto.json`) rather than a
  constant that can go stale. A gate does not stop it; a closure that names motor vehicles does.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#on-a-dirt-bike-the-fourth-mode)
- **The worst case belongs to the mode, and for a rider it is a ride.** A gate nobody mapped is
  invisible to every figure, so every mode shows an "if the gravel is gated" bound — but that bound is
  "the same walk from the nearest paved road" only for the two modes a closure strands on foot. On
  either bike you unload at the pavement and ride, which is why the machine is in the truck: one more
  Dijkstra per rider, seeded at the pavement instead of at the car, stored in the mode's own file
  (`RIDE_WORST_AT`). At Deming the walker's bound is 5.5 h and the dirt bike's is **1.5 h** over the
  same 7.7 mi; v9 printed the 5.5 h under all four modes. **An overstatement is not automatically the
  safe direction** — it was out by a factor of 3.7 here and 14 at the worst cell in the state, in the
  one case the mode exists for. It is still a bound: it starts at the pavement, and every legal block
  still applies, so a road closed to motor vehicles stops the dirt bike whatever the gravel is doing.
  Two properties are checked on every cell — never quicker than the mode's own figure, never slower
  than walking the same road, both 0.4% with causes named.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#the-worst-case-belongs-to-the-mode)
- **One file per mode, and the base file for what they share.** `access.json` carries the categories,
  the worst case and nothing else; each mode's columns live in `data/access-<mode>.json`, fetched when
  that mode goes on screen and merged into the same per-cell objects the sheet reads. That is what
  let a fourth mode land without pushing the up-front download past 3 MB, and a per-mode worst case
  land after it without either of the walking modes paying for it: **1.60 MB base + 0.63 MB (hike) to
  1.04 MB (bike)** as Pages serves them, so 2.23 MB up front on foot and 2.64 MB for a rider, against
  2.93 MB for three modes in one file. Size these against the deployed host and never against
  `gzip -9`, which flattered the figure once. A mode file is version-checked and refused on its own.
- **A bike is carried to where the car stops, then rides what it is allowed to ride.** Everything a
  walker may use except two absolutes: designated wilderness (federal law, from the USFS EDW layer,
  marked per EDGE because a trail crosses a boundary mid-way) and `bicycle=no|private|dismount`.
  **A road closed to MOTORIZED use does not stop a bicycle** — `BIKE_BLOCKS_CLOSED_ROADS` is false
  since v9, reversed at the user's request on the measurement (8.8% of cells quicker, median 12 min).
  Do not re-tighten it from the original instruction; ROADMAP.md records the reversal. **"Carried" is load-bearing**: the bike's sources are network NODES and a car stops
  anywhere along an edge, so without the carried predicate the bike rode the last 500 m of a road the
  car could have driven and 9,157 cells read slower by bike than on foot. A bike figure must never be
  worse than the hike's. The wilderness layer covers the Forest Service and not the national parks,
  where bicycles are banned on nearly every trail; `BIKE_PARK_NOTE` says so on the sheet.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#by-bike-the-third-mode)
- **Where the data ends, the sheet says so.** The bake holds Washington's roads and about 2.8 km
  past them, so a cell near a LAND border can be handed the long way round: the state's deepest
  drive, 134 minutes and 35 miles, is a cell 2.7 km from Idaho whose nearest pavement is four miles
  east, in Idaho. `edgeDoubt()` fires when the data ends inside half a figure's own length, and the
  tap sheet prints one line naming the neighbour — 892 of 46,923 cells, once per sheet rather than
  once per figure. The Pacific coast and the Strait are deliberately not borders for this: no road is
  missing out there. Nothing is stored for it, so it costs no re-bake, and the one case it gets wrong
  is a REGIONAL bake, whose coverage ends at its own bbox.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#the-edge-of-the-data-is-a-figure-of-its-own)
- **Junctions are inferred, and the error rate is measured, not assumed.** 9.3% of the joins the
  network makes are ones OpenStreetMap does not confirm — 4.6% where both ways are forest classes,
  20.4% in town. Removing them all changes 6.2% of hike figures and 1.7% of difficulty buckets. The
  recall is 95.7%. Re-measure after any change to `SNAP_M`, the crossing test or the simplification
  tolerance: the `onJoin` hook in `access-network.mjs` exists for exactly that, and the method is in
  [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md#the-false-junction-rate-measured).
- **`access-geom.json` stays whole and lazy**, fetched for the *tapped* approach only: clipped
  geometry is right for drawing and wrong for measuring, and a clip is what truncated trails
  before v4.
- **The routes are fetched one region at a time, and the region is derived, never listed.**
  `routeShardKey(i, j)` in `src/access.mjs` is the only place that decides which of the 264 files a
  cell's line is in, so the bake and the app cannot disagree — the same rule `src/grid.mjs` follows
  for the lattice. A **missing shard is an answer**: most of the Columbia basin has no routes, and the
  app remembers the null rather than asking again. A **statewide bake owns the directory** and deletes
  a shard that has no routes left; a regional one touches only its own shards and merges each. One
  file was 3.4 MB fetched at a trailhead; a shard is a median 8 KB, 52 KB at worst.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#the-routes-are-fetched-one-region-at-a-time)
- **Every entry gets its access from the cell that contains it, in one place.**
  `withAccess()` in `index.html` wraps every `makeEntry` call — baked cells, the
  sub-mile refine, a live block score, an exact point. It cannot live in
  `makeEntry` itself, which is in `src/model/` and may not know how reachable a
  cell is. Three of those four paths once lacked the lookup, so tapping the map
  and opening the same cell from Top spots disagreed, and the tap read as
  "nothing is mapped" — a false negative wearing the honest answer's clothes.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#a-tap-and-a-top-spots-row-must-be-the-same-cell)
- **"Examined and found nothing" and "never examined" are different answers.**
  The access bake covers the cells in `cells.json`; a point outside that set —
  31.5% of in-state taps — was never looked at, and says so. Only a cell the bake
  actually walked may read as *unknown*.
- **Access data says what is *mapped*, never what exists.** A cell with nothing
  mapped nearby reads as *unknown*, not as trailless — coverage on private
  timberland is patchy, and absence of a mapped way is not absence of a way.
  The same applies to the walk and the climb: with no trailhead to measure from
  they are reported as unavailable, never computed from an arbitrary point, and
  past `WALK_DOUBT` (10 mi) the **total** approach is labelled, never capped or
  hidden — the figure is real and the caveat says what it probably means.
- **An approach has two legs and both are reported.** On-trail from the trailhead
  to the nearest point on the route, then **off-trail in a straight line** from
  there to the cell centre, then the total. v4 reported only the first and stopped
  at the trail, so 924 cells read "0 ft" while the route was up to 1.9 km away.
  The off-trail leg always carries `OFF_TRAIL_NOTE`: it ignores terrain, brush and
  water. A total climb is reported only when both halves are measured.
  [docs/access.md](docs/access.md#the-walk-was-the-wrong-quantity)
- **A trailhead is a coordinate, not a flag.** `thArc` comes from projecting that
  point onto the finished route, so it cannot depend on which end met the road or
  on `joinRoutes` reversing a member. A trailhead that cannot be placed yields no
  walk at all, never a walk from an assumed end.

## Current phase

Phase 0 groundwork, on top of the model work that has just landed: the model
extracted into `src/model/`, the bake moved out of the browser into
`scripts/build-cells.mjs`, host rules restructured into land-cover caps plus
species identity, and a joint stand-structure factor replacing
`fCanopy × fHeight`.

Next, all of which need cells re-baked and none of which belongs in a UI: PRISM
precipitation multipliers, SSURGO soil water capacity, NIFC fire perimeters, and
the **30 m habitat rebuild** — queued with its measurements in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#queued-the-30-m-habitat-rebuild--fetch-to-a-checkpoint-first-decide-what-to-emit-after).
`data/cells.json` is format 2 and carries per-sample vegetation types, so
host-rule changes no longer need a re-bake. **Batch whatever needs a re-bake into
one**, since hard rule 3 makes a re-bake an event: the elevation plausibility
check is queued against exactly that occasion.

**Deliberately left open:** the score bands (25/45/65/80) were calibrated against
the old, more optimistic distribution, and nothing currently reaches "very high" —
on 2026-09-12 the deployed app read 622 sq mi at medium+ of 48,032 with a ceiling
of 75. That may simply be correct for a dry September. The test is mid-October,
when conditions should be genuinely peak — **do not retune the bands against one
dry week.**

**And the band reading comes before the habitat rebuild**, decided by the user on
2026-09-12: a rebuild re-bases habitat scores, so doing both at once would leave
the October reading unable to separate "the weather finally got good" from
"habitat was re-based", spending the season's one calibration. Four weeks costs
nothing. Do not reorder this to start the rebuild sooner.

## How to test

```bash
npm test                  # everything: model suite, then data and script suites
npm run test:model        # tests/model/ — relational, snapshot, purity
npm run test:data         # scripts/*.test.mjs
npm run snapshots:update  # deliberate — then READ THE DIFF
```

CI runs the full suite on every push and pull request to `dev` and `main`.

The suite has two halves with **opposite** rules. Relational assertions compare
fixtures against each other and survive retuning — **never relax one to make a
failing model pass**. Snapshots record exact numbers and *are* meant to move when
you tune; a snapshot failure is a question, not a verdict.

After any significant change, check the suite still bites: reintroduce the bug it
was built for and confirm the expected tests fail. A test that cannot fail is not
protecting anything. [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)

`npm test` is the floor, not the bar. This app fails quietly enough that a
handful of specific checks have each caught something real — counting unresolved
cells rather than trusting the coverage guard, proving a request did *not*
happen, measuring the grid seam instead of eyeballing the map.
[docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md)

## How to run it locally

```bash
node scripts/serve.mjs 8080
```

Then <http://localhost:8080>. `localhost` is neither a production nor a staging
host, so it always reads its own `data/weather.json`. Check `PUBLIC_MODE` at the
top of the script first: `true` reads only the baked files (what ships), `false`
calls Open-Meteo and LANDFIRE live from the browser.

Node 24 is at `C:\Program Files\nodejs`; the `python` on PATH is the Windows
Store stub and does not run. [docs/development.md](docs/development.md)

## How to deploy

```bash
git push preview dev:dev     # staging → dev.wheretoforage.com
```

That is the entire staging deploy: one plain push, no force, no follow-up.

Landing to production means rebasing `dev` onto `main` first, since `main`
accumulates automated `weather.json` commits that `dev` will not have, then
fast-forwarding `main`. A merge conflicts on `data/weather.json` — it is a
generated artifact, so resolve by taking whichever side you mean to ship, never
by hand-merging. After a rebase the mirrors need realigning with a lease. Full
procedure, including rollback: [docs/deploys.md](docs/deploys.md)

Baking data:

```bash
node scripts/build-cells.mjs            # ~4 min: 305 terrain tiles, 579 LANDFIRE requests
node scripts/build-cells.mjs --resume   # after a connect timeout
node scripts/build-cells.mjs --region=coast
node scripts/build-access.mjs           # 40-80 min: ~316 Overpass tiles + USFS + terrain
node scripts/build-access.mjs --resume  # re-assembles in under a minute, zero requests*
```

**Log a long bake to a file you can read while it runs.** `node
scripts/build-access.mjs > bake.log 2>&1` and tail the file. Piping it through
`tail -60` buffers everything until the process exits, which left a 90-minute run
with checkpoint file size as its only progress signal — no tile count, no ETA, and
no way to tell a slow mirror from a wedged one. Same class of mistake as leaving a
waiter process parked on a job that has already finished.

**If the bake gives trouble again, do not add a fifth Overpass mirror.** Four runs
have now been degraded by Overpass one way or another. The fix is a local
Geofabrik extract; see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

**The 30 m habitat checkpoint is a fetch, not a rebuild.** `data/habitat-30m.checkpoint/` (323 MB,
gitignored) holds LANDFIRE's EVT, EVC and EVH at native 30 m over Washington — 591 gzipped Int16
tiles and a manifest. **Nothing reads it yet and nothing may**: the per-cell-summary versus
per-pixel-tiles decision waits on the October band reading, and until then no score moves and
`cells.json` does not change. `node scripts/fetch-habitat.mjs --resume` tops it up; a satisfied
resume costs four seconds. The grid's phase is the trap — native pixel edges are at 15 mod 30 in
EPSG:5070, not multiples of 30 — and `habitat-grid.mjs` is the only place that knows it.
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md#a-test-that-agrees-with-you-by-construction)

**The access checkpoint is kept on success and re-assembling from it is free.**
Everything after the fetch — the category rules, trailhead inference, which way
each cell is nearest, route joining, elevation, the row format — is assembly.
The checkpoint holds only what the sources said. Deleting it once turned an
assembly change into a ten-hour re-fetch. Do not "tidy up" by removing it.

\* A checkpoint from before schema 2 is **upgraded, not refused**: USFS is
fetched again by page (~25 requests) and the OSM tags that describe a road are
asked for by tag (a few Overpass requests). After that, zero requests again.

`data/weather.json` maintains itself — `weather.yml` runs two crons, one for both
grids and one forecast-only. [docs/weather-archive.md](docs/weather-archive.md)

## What not to touch

- **`data/cells.json`** — see hard rule 3.
- **`data/evt-names.json`** — 1,069 LANDFIRE codes, checked in because the
  service stopped publishing the mapping and there is no live source for it any
  more. Do not reconstruct codes from legend order.
  [docs/landfire-vegetation.md](docs/landfire-vegetation.md)
- **The repository guards** in `.github/workflows/`.
- **`data/habitat-30m.checkpoint/`** — 323 MB of fetched 30 m raster, gitignored and kept on
  purpose. Re-fetching it is 20 minutes and 1.23 GB; deleting it to tidy up is the mistake the access
  checkpoint's history already records.
- **`pointKey`'s five decimals** and the `axisFor()` start/end asymmetry. Both
  look like inconsistencies and are load-bearing.
- **Open-Meteo's `models=` parameter.** Pinning `ecmwf_ifs025` would populate the
  soil variables and silently change the provenance of precipitation and
  temperature, moving every score.
