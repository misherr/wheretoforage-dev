# Architecture: what each file is for
Moved out of `CLAUDE.md` so that file can stay short. This is the long form —
every file, what it does, and the reasoning that is not obvious from reading it.

## Files

- **`src/grid.mjs`** — the cell lattice (`DLAT`/`DLON`/`BLK`, `cellCenter`,
  `cellKey`), the Washington outline (`inWA`), and `terrainAt()` for slope and
  aspect. Imported by **both** `index.html` and `scripts/build-cells.mjs`, and
  that is the point: while `cells.json` came out of a button inside the app there
  was exactly one copy of this geometry by construction, and with a separate bake
  script there would be two. See "The script must agree with the app" — that
  mistake has already cost this repo 5,844 mismatched cells once and 74 orphaned
  anchors another time. It also carries `pointKey`, the elevation-cache key, which
  now matches `cellCenter`'s five decimals — it truncated to four, and that
  quietly cost 77 of every 300 cells a two-sided north-south gradient.
- **`src/model/`** — the ecological model, extracted from `index.html` so that
  changing the science does not mean reading the whole application: `util.mjs`
  (numeric curves, unit conversions, score bands), `habitat.mjs` (region,
  season, elevation band), `weather-score.mjs` (`analyze`, `fullAnalysis`,
  `adjustWeather`, `verdict`), `phenology.mjs` (the fruiting-stage mix),
  `vegetation.mjs` (LANDFIRE host quality) and `cell.mjs` (the composition
  root: `makeEntry`/`applyVeg`). Pure functions, no DOM, no fetch, no Leaflet,
  deterministic. **Read `src/model/CLAUDE.md` before changing anything in
  there** — it carries the rules for the directory, and
  `tests/model/purity.test.mjs` enforces them.
- **`index.html`** — the app around the model. Leaflet map, canvas-rendered overlay of
  ~23,000 one-square-mile cells, a layers menu (chance / habitat quality /
  trailing 7-day rain / soil moisture, multi-select), a play-through timeline
  for the 7-day forecast, a tap-a-cell breakdown sheet, a "Top spots" panel,
  and a "How it works" info panel.
  - The inline script is `<script type="module">` and imports from
    `./src/model/`. That makes a local server **mandatory** — see "Local
    development"; `file://` fails CORS on every import and the page renders
    blank with a console error that does not obviously say so.
  - `const PUBLIC_MODE` near the top of the script switches the whole
    app between two modes:
    - `false` — live API mode: fetches Open-Meteo weather and LANDFIRE
      vegetation itself, used for local development only. It no longer bakes
      `data/cells.json` — `scripts/build-cells.mjs` does that.
    - `true` — public mode: reads only `data/cells.json` and
      `data/weather.json`, never calls an API from the phone. This is what
      gets deployed (GitHub Pages).
- **`data/cells.json`** — baked per-cell elevation, slope, aspect, and
  LANDFIRE 2024 vegetation (tree fraction, canopy %, stand height,
  host-quality score, top vegetation types), **plus the four per-sample
  vegetation types and a tree-class bitmask per cell** (format 2), which is what
  lets host quality be recomputed at load time instead of frozen at bake time —
  a host-rule change no longer needs a re-bake. Also a `provenance` block
  recording the generator and version, the LANDFIRE product year, the terrain
  tile source and when it ran. Produced by `scripts/build-cells.mjs`. **Do not regenerate or
  overwrite unless asked** — the checked-in copy is the real data the user
  produced, and a rebuild moves slope and aspect for ~7,000 cells, which moves
  scores. See "Slope and aspect: why the checked-in values changed".
- **`data/evt-names.json`** — LANDFIRE EVT code → class name, 1,069 entries,
  checked in because the service no longer publishes the mapping anywhere. See
  "LANDFIRE EVT: the mapping is checked in, and why" before touching it.
- **`scripts/fetch-weather.mjs`** — Node script, no dependencies. Maintains
  `data/weather.json` as a **rolling two-grid archive** (see "The two grids").
  Anchors that already have history refetch only their grid's short window,
  new ones fetch `PAST_FULL` *or deeper if the archive already reaches further
  back*, and the fresh window is merged into the stored series by date (fresh
  values overwrite overlapping days, new days append, each anchor trimmed to
  30 past days + its grid's forecast). Requests 10 daily variables because the
  variable count is free at the 1.0-call floor; a probe drops any the API
  rejects *or* returns all-null for (currently both 0–7 cm soil aggregates,
  which only populate under `models=ecmwf_ifs025` — do not pin that model, it
  would change the provenance of precipitation and temperature and move every
  score). Keeps per-request timeout, retry-on-thrown-fetch-error,
  checkpoint/resume, and the >25% failure abort, and adds a daily call ledger
  (see "Call budget").
- **`scripts/build-cells.mjs`** — bakes `data/cells.json`. Node, no
  dependencies. Imports `everHabitat` and `vegSummary` from `src/model/` and the
  lattice from `src/grid.mjs`, so it cannot disagree with the app about either
  the science or the geometry. Reads elevation from the Terrarium terrain tiles
  (with its own PNG decoder — Node has no canvas and this repo has no
  dependencies), samples LANDFIRE EVT/EVC/EVH at four points per cell, and writes
  rows in lattice scan order so the file diffs. Checkpoints before the first
  request, every 5 batches, and again on failure, so a connect timeout costs
  minutes rather than the whole run — re-run with `--resume`.
  `--region=<name>` or `--bbox=lat0,lon0,lat1,lon1` re-bakes part of the state
  and merges into the existing file, sampling one block of apron so an edge
  cell's slope does not depend on which region produced it. A full statewide
  bake is 305 terrain tiles + 579 LANDFIRE requests, about 4 minutes.
- **`scripts/build-cells.test.mjs`** — `node --test scripts/build-cells.test.mjs`.
  No network: the two service calls are injected, so checkpoint/resume is tested
  against synthetic terrain rather than against whether LANDFIRE agrees with
  itself twice. Covers the quarter-point geometry against `vegFor`'s own
  expression, the lattice, the PNG decoder on all five filter types, provenance,
  the regional merge, and that a resumed bake equals an uninterrupted one.
- **`src/access.mjs`** — the access vocabulary: what counts as a trail, a
  drivable road or a rough way, the distance thresholds, and the labels. Shared
  by the bake script and the app so the two cannot disagree. Deliberately
  outside `src/model/`: access is not an input to any score. See
  [access.md](access.md).
- **`scripts/build-access.mjs`** — bakes `data/access.json` from OpenStreetMap
  (via Overpass) and USFS roads and trails. Tiled, resumable, and it subdivides
  an area when Overpass cannot answer for it, which is how the metro tiles get
  done. `--region`/`--bbox` merge into the existing file.
- **`scripts/build-access.test.mjs`** — no network. Covers the classification,
  the polyline densification, the tiling, the regional merge, and the assertion
  that matters most: that nothing under `src/model/` can see access at all.
- **`scripts/access-network.mjs`** — the route network: every fetched way,
  joined where ways meet (ends, sides, crossings — inferred, because the
  checkpoint has no node ids), where a car can get to from pavement, how long the
  drive there takes, what a bicycle may ride of it, and the walk from there. One
  `vehicleReach`/`vehicleApproaches` pair serves the car and the bike: they differ
  in which edges they may use, how fast each kind of way is and where they start,
  and in nothing else. Pure: elevation is injected, nothing
  is fetched. `onJoin` is an audit seam — every inferred join is offered to it and
  can be vetoed, which is how the false-junction rate is measured
  ([verification.md](verification.md#the-false-junction-rate-measured)).
- **`scripts/access-modes.mjs`** — per-cell mode figures from that network: the
  hike approach, the drive and the walk left after it, the bike ride and the walk
  left after that, the worst case from the nearest paved road, the straight-in
  alternative, where each vehicle stops and why, and the routes file for drawing.
  It copies each way into the network by hand, so **every field a rule stamps has
  to be added to that copy** — `ml`, `bk` and `closed` were once missing from it,
  which made the drive's 25 mph class unreachable and 9,106 `bicycle=no` ways
  block nothing.
- **`data/access.json`** — the base file (v10): per-cell distance to the nearest
  mapped trail, road and rough way, then the worst-case walk from the pavement —
  which the hike and the drive share, the riding modes carrying their own — keyed by
  cell index rather than row position. 6.05 MB, 1.60 MB over the wire. Optional at
  runtime: without it every cell reads as unknown and the app is otherwise
  unchanged.
- **`data/access-hike.json`, `-drive.json`, `-bike.json`, `-moto.json`** — one
  mode's columns each, 0.63 MB (hike) to 1.04 MB (bike) over the wire, fetched when
  that mode goes on screen and merged into the per-cell objects the sheet reads. Up
  to v8 every mode shared one row of one file, which was 2.93 MB over the wire with
  three modes and every byte of it fetched by a viewer who uses one. The two riding
  files are the larger ones because each carries **its own worst case** (v10): the
  "if the gravel is gated" bound ridden rather than walked, nine columns, which the
  hike and the drive do not need and do not pay for. `access-moto.json` also carries
  `excluded`, the trail mileage its designation rule leaves out, so the sheet can
  say so from the data rather than from a constant.
- **`data/habitat-30m.checkpoint/`** — LANDFIRE EVT, EVC and EVH at native
  30 m over Washington: 591 gzipped row-major `Int16LE` tiles of 1,024² pixels
  plus a manifest, 323 MB, **gitignored and not read by anything yet**. The fetch
  stage of the 30 m habitat rebuild, done ahead of the decision about what to emit
  from it so that the expensive part is not on the critical path twice. Written by
  `scripts/fetch-habitat.mjs`; the grid, the EPSG:5070 projection and the TIFF
  reader are in `scripts/habitat-grid.mjs`, pure and tested offline.
- **`data/access-routes/`** — the route each cell's figure walks, in **264 regional
  files** of 16 cells square, one fetched when "Show the route" is tapped and each
  stamped with the bake. Per shard: a table of way stretches and, per cell, a list
  into it, for the hike, the drive where its walk differs (1,758 cells) and the bike
  where its line differs (14,063). `routeShardKey` in `src/access.mjs` names the
  file, and it is the only thing that does. It replaced a single 13 MB file — 3.4 MB
  over the wire, fetched whole at the moment a forager at a trailhead asked for one
  line.
- **`scripts/serve.mjs`** — dependency-free static server for local
  development, `node scripts/serve.mjs [port]`. Exists because the app can no
  longer be opened over `file://`, and because it guarantees the `.mjs` MIME
  type: served as anything but `text/javascript` the browser refuses the module
  with an error that looks nothing like its cause.
- **`scripts/evt-names.test.mjs`** — `node --test scripts/evt-names.test.mjs`.
  Guards the checked-in EVT table: not truncated, the three live-verified codes
  still resolve, every type name `cells.json` uses is producible from it, no
  forested cell is missing a type, and unknown never outranks known-mediocre.
  Imports `hostOf`, `HOST_SPECIES` and `NON_HOST_COVER` from the model rather
  than copying them, so it cannot drift from the tuned constants it checks. It
  also records the four host species LF2024 never names — see
  `src/model/CLAUDE.md`, "What the vegetation data cannot say".
- **`tests/model/`** — regression fixtures for the ecological model, run by `npm test`.
  See "Model regression suite" below before changing anything in there; the two halves
  have opposite rules about when they may be updated. `purity.test.mjs` additionally
  enforces the rules in `src/model/CLAUDE.md` — no DOM, no fetch, no map, no clock,
  no imports outside the directory.
- **`package.json`** — no dependencies and no build step; it exists only to wire up
  `npm test`, `npm run test:model`, `npm run test:data` and `npm run snapshots:update`.
- **`scripts/fetch-weather.test.mjs`** — `node --test scripts/fetch-weather.test.mjs`.
  Covers the merge (a rolling fetch merged into an archive must equal a single
  full fetch, including at the window boundary), trimming, ragged-series
  detection, the stride-nesting property, the anchor join at every stride, the
  per-grid resume windows, and the seam (that bias correction removes the step
  at today rather than smearing it).
- **`.github/workflows/weather.yml`** — one workflow, two crons. `30 11 * * *`
  runs both grids; `30 23 * * *` runs the forecast grid only. The mode comes
  from `github.event.schedule`, so there is one guard, one checkout and one
  commit step instead of two files to keep in sync. Guarded to the production
  repo (see "Both workflows are repository-guarded").
- **`README.md`** — deployment steps and workflow-failure troubleshooting.
